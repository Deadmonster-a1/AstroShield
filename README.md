# 🛰️ AstroShield: Space Traffic Intelligence & Satellite Collision Prevention

AstroShield is a futuristic web application designed to **visualize real-time satellite movements**, **predict potential collisions using AI**, and **analyze space traffic data** around Earth. Built with **Three.js**, **React.js**, and optional AI integration via Python, AstroShield offers a visually stunning and interactive 3D interface for monitoring satellite dynamics.

## 🌍 Features

### 🌐 1. Interactive 3D Earth (Globe View)
- Built using **Three.js** to render a realistic rotating Earth.
- Includes night/day cycle, clouds, and atmosphere glow.
- Orbit controls for full globe exploration.
- Users can click/zoom/pan to explore any region on Earth.

### 🛰️ 2. Real-Time Satellite Tracking
- Loads live satellite data from **Celestrak/NORAD** sources.
- Visualizes satellite orbits in 3D around Earth.
- Animate satellites moving along their orbital path.
- Hover/click on a satellite to view its details.

### 🤖 3. AI-Powered Collision Prediction
- AI model (Random Forest or TensorFlow) checks for satellite proximity.
- Highlights potential collision paths and predicts impact risks.
- Backend support with Python (FastAPI) to process and return results.

### 📊 4. Space Traffic & Risk Analytics
- Real-time analytics dashboard for:
  - Total satellites in orbit
  - Risk heatmaps
  - Traffic by orbital altitude/shell
  - Congestion by country or region

### 🔍 5. Satellite Metadata Explorer
- Click on satellites to view:
  - NORAD ID, name, country, mission
  - Launch date, orbit type, altitude, velocity
- Sidebar or modal display with metadata and external links.
