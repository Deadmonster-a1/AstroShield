This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

- 📈 **Interactive Analytics Dashboard** powered by Plotly.js and Chart.js  
- 🤖 **TLE Data Input** with animated prediction results from AI models  
- 🌌 **Immersive UI/UX** with dark mode, glassmorphism, and smooth animations  
- 📁 **File Uploader** for TLE data  
- 🌍 **Responsive Design** for mobile and desktop  
- 🔔 **Toast Notifications**, tooltips, loaders, and modals for smooth user experience  
- 🧭 **Searchable Sidebar**, tabbed views, collapsible sections, and infographics  
- 🧩 **Modular Components** and scalable architecture using React + Tailwind CSS  
- 🌠 **Animated Hero Section** with starfield background (Vanta.js or tsParticles)  
- 🎨 Built with **accessibility (a11y)** and **performance-first design**
